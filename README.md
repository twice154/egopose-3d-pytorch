# *x*R-EgoPose

This repository contains the unoffical pyTorch implementation of xR-EgoPose in the paper ["*x*R-EgoPose: Egocentric 3D Human Pose from an HMD Camera"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Tome_xR-EgoPose_Egocentric_3D_Human_Pose_From_an_HMD_Camera_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) (ICCV 2019, oral). (**Failed to implement similar performance reported on the paper.**)

I tried to implement (the paper didn't mention explicitly.)
* Neural Network Architecture
* Data Augmentation Strategy
* Training Details
